# Before each onboarding session

Set up Minute Cards using the [Virtual Minute Card template](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1p7iOV5HNvy4POS4g6eottY8RSfKq4kaoKz1-jIFYTMI/edit) and have onboarding individuals fill them after each session. This will allow you to get feedback and pre-emptively address questions, as well as tailor your onboarding.

# Onboarding session #1 

- The goal of this session is to **start engaging new Maintainers in the Carpentries community**, and to begin to build personal relationships with others as well as placing faces to names. The #1 thing we learned from Maintainers before we rebooted the training was that they felt isolated and that they didn't know where to turn for help, so building community is a key goal of this first session, before plunging into content for the rest of the other sessions.
- Additionally, for some Maintainers, this may be their first exposure to contributing in the Carpentries, so we want to ensure they feel comfortable, are socialized into Carpentries values, and that they engage with why they wanted to get involved in the first place.
- It is good to frame yourself as someone who doesn't know everything about Git/Github (i.e. "you don't need a Git black belt to be an effective Maintainer!"), as this is something that can be intimidating to an individual joining the Maintainer community. Emphasize that the reason we have teams of Maintainers is so that we can learn from each other.
- Invite Carpentries staff to join for a little while. They will get to see all the individuals engaged in Onboarding, and new Maintainers will get to place a face to the names they may repeatedly hear.
