## Interacting with Your Fellow Maintainers

As a Maintainer, you will be part of an overlapping set of teams.
From smallest to largest, these include:

* **Your Lesson Team** - the Maintainers who work with you on your lesson (a single GitHub repository).
* **Your Curricular Team** - Maintainers who work on your lesson and other lessons taught in the same workshop.
* **Your Technology Team** - Maintainers who work on other lessons that teach the same tool.
* **The full Maintainer Team** - all Carpentry Maintainers.

> ## Find Your Technology Team!
>
> For our exercises today, we will be working with your Technology
> Team. In the Etherpad, next to your name, write the name of your
> lesson (including whether it is a DC or SWC lesson). Identify your
> group number and put it next to your name:
>
> 1) R Maintainers
> 2) Python Maintainers
> 3) SQL Maintainers
> 4) Unix / Git / and other Maintainers
{: .challenge}

The overall Maintainer team communicates via our [mailing list](http://lists.software-carpentry.org/listinfo/maintainers).
Please make sure you are signed up, as this is the primary
communication channel for all Maintainer-related information. We also
have monthly meetings to discuss topics relevant to the
Maintainer community. You can find the times for these meetings
on the
[community calendar](https://software-carpentry.org/join/#calendar)
and on the [Maintainer Etherpad](http://pad.software-carpentry.org/maintainers).

There is a separate email list for people going through
Maintainer onboarding. To sign up for this list, visit our
[Google Group](https://groups.google.com/a/carpentries.org/forum/#!forum/maintainer-onboarding).

It is important to stay in touch with your Lesson Team.
All Lesson Teams work
differently, and you will need to find a communication style and
distribution of work that works for you. We recommend that, at
a minimum, your team meets by video-conference once a quarter to
set priorities and deal with existing concerns.

There are several decisions that your Lesson Team will need to make
about how you will work together. Here are some issues you should
consider:

* Who will be responsible for what?
* How often will we each work on the lesson?
* What are our expectations for our repo in terms of response time,
turn-around time, issue tagging, etc.

> ## Make a List (10 min)
> With your break-out group, discuss the points above and
> add to this list. What are other things that you want to
> communicate about with your Lesson Team?
{: .challenge}

> ## Follow-up Homework
> Get in touch with your Lesson Team to schedule an initial
> meeting. At this meeting, be sure to discuss the issues in the list
> generated above. Communicating by email can also help to set the
> stage for your initial meeting and clarify any of these items
> after the meeting.
{: .challenge}

> ## Getting Set up on Zoom
> The Carpentries use Zoom for video-conferencing. You
> can get a personal Zoom account by going to [https://www.zoom.us/](https://www.zoom.us/) and clicking the `SIGN UP, IT'S FREE`
> button in the upper right corner. After signing up, click `Go to My Account` to see your personal Zoom meeting link.
> You can invite people to your personal meeting by sending them
> your personal meeting ID URL. Free accounts have a 40-minute limit
> on meetings with 3 or more participants, but meetings can be restarted.

## Interacting with Other Contributors

Maintainers represent the Carpentries on some of our most
active online spaces - our GitHub repositories. As a Maintainer,
you will often be the first point of contact for people new to the
Carpentries community.

Igor Steinmacher, a computer scientist who researches
retention of open source contributors, provides [a set of
recommendations](http://wsl.softwarelivre.org/2015/0002/fostering-freelibre-open-source-software-community-formation:-guidelines-for-communities-to-support-newcomers-onboarding-wsl-2015.pdf) based on his research on how to reduce barriers to
new contributors becoming part of your community. While some of these
are more specific to software projects, some are very applicable to
our (or any) community:

* Answer quickly
* Be kind and make newcomers feel part of the team
* Set expectations and needs early
* Point newcomers to easy tasks
* Keep the issue list clean and triaged
* Dismiss or identify outdated information
* Create a live FAQ section

> ## Preparatory Homework
> Pick one of the points above and be prepared to discuss how
> you feel the Carpentry community does overall in meeting this
> recommendation. Can you identify ways in which we could improve?
{: .challenge}

> ## Discussion (10 min)
> In your breakout groups, share your thoughts on the points you
> selected. Add your notes to the Etherpad.
{: .discussion}

When interacting with contributors, whether new or old, we want to
be sure to embody Carpentry values around communication and teaching
and learning.

> ## Preparatory Homework
> Review the episode on [Motivation and Demotivation](http://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/08-motivation/)
> from Instructor Training. Make some notes for yourself about
> how the factors discussed in this episode should influence the
> way we interact with contributors.
> > ## Solution
> > * Teach Most Useful First - we can (and should) politely turn down contributions that take the material out of the scope of the novice learner or that involve unnecessary and distracting technical detail.
> > * Actual Time - everything will probably take longer for learners than it does for you. Limit new additions to the materials and encourage cutting material where needed.
> > * Things You Shouldn't Do in a Workshop - these are also things we shouldn't do in a PR or Issue conversation.
> > * Imposter Syndrome - be encouraging to new contributors, even if they make a formatting mistake.
> > * Accessibility - take seriously any comments a contributor makes about accessibility issues.
> > * Inclusivity - avoid unnecessary use of gendered pronouns and other exclusive language.

Some summary text.

## GitHub Etiquette and Processes

> ## Preparatory Homework
> Read the Carpentry [Contributor Guidelines](https://github.com/swcarpentry/lesson-example/blob/gh-pages/CONTRIBUTING.md) and
> work through those instructions to make a contribution to this
> repository. Even if you're already familiar with Git and GitHub,
> follow those instructions carefully. Pay attention to anything that
> was unclear or didn't work as you expected. Be prepared to discuss.
{: .challenge}

> ## Discussion
> How easy was it to use our Contributor Guidelines? Was there
> anything unclear or difficult? What things do you think will
> be confusing for new GitHub users?
{: .discussion}

In addition to formal contributor guidelines, the Carpentries have an
unstated (until now!) but commonly used set of community norms for working with
GitHub. These include:

* **Including appropriate cross-references:**
    If putting in a PR to address an existing issue, include a link to the Issue. GitHub will automatically add a note to the Issue linking back to the PR. This is also good practice when communicating in conversation threads on related Issues and PRs.

* **Using the `@` symbol to tag people in a conversation:**
    Most people don't subscribe to all of the SWC/DC repositories (there are a lot!) and will only get email alerts if their GitHub handle is tagged. This is a good way to make sure relevant people are included in the conversation.

* **Requesting reviews:**
    You can request a review from a fellow Maintainer or from someone else who has been active on the repository. This is another way of including relevant people in the decision-making process.

* **Not merging your own PRs:**
    Even for small PRs, it's a good idea to have a second pair of eyes to check for typos and formatting issues. In general, always get a second opinion before merging your own PR. This is a good time to request a review.

Being open to new contributions while keeping the lessons sleek and
teachable is a difficult balancing act. It's ok to say no to a
contribution when it doesn't add anything useful to the materials,
goes beyond the scope of the lesson, or introduces unnecessary
complexity. Even when saying no, however, we want to have positive
interactions with contributors and let them know that their
involvement is valued. GitHub's [OpenSource Guide for Maintainers](https://opensource.guide/best-practices/#learning-to-say-no)
has an excellent discussion on learning to say no.

> ## Preparatory Homework
> Read ["Learning to Say No"](https://opensource.guide/best-practices/#learning-to-say-no). Be prepared to discuss how you can implement these suggestions as a Maintainer.
{: .challenge}

> ## Exercise
> With your breakout group, select one PR or Issue that has been
> open for > 6 months. Read the comments and discuss what the problem
> is (i.e. why hasn't the PR been merged). Draft a response to the
> PR/Issue in the Etherpad. If you're comfortable doing so, add your
> response to the conversation and tag the other Maintainers for the lesson.
