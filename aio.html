<p>The Carpentries supports over 40 official lessons across our three
Lesson Programs (Data Carpentry, Library Carpentry, and Software
Carpentry). At any given time, there are also dozens of
community-supported lessons in active development in <a href="https://carpentries-incubator.org/" class="external-link">The Carpentries Incubator</a>.
This training is intended for Maintainers of official lessons, and we
will not cover how new lessons are developed, vetted, and adopted into
The Carpentries core lesson stack. Those interested in curriculum
development are encouraged to read The Carpentries <a href="https://cdh.carpentries.org/" class="external-link">Curriculum Development Handbook</a>.
We also offer <a href="https://carpentries.github.io/lesson-development-training/" class="external-link">training
in collaborative lesson development</a>.</p>
<p>We do not expect you to be an expert in Git or GitHub, or even to
have used these tools at all in the past. We will provide you with an
introduction to the core skills you need to respond to uncomplicated
issues and pull requests, however, there will undoubtedly be more
complicated maintenance situations that require Git skills beyond what
we will cover in this training. The best way to learn Git is to work
with it, and we encourage you to reach out to your co-Maintainers and
others in the Maintainer community for support and resources. We have
monthly Maintainer meetings where you can bring questions to the group,
and also provide each other support in asynchronous communication
channels. We’ll introduce those channels later in this onboarding. The
Software Carpentry <a href="https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/" class="external-link">Git Novice lesson</a>
and the Library Carpentry <a href="https://librarycarpentry.org/lc-git/" class="external-link">Introduction to Git
lesson</a> are also great resources for learning and reviewing the core
skills you will need to maintain your lesson.</p>

<hr class="half-width">
<p>The Carpentries teaches 400 - 600 workshops each year, meaning our
lesson materials are being used practically every day for synchronous,
guided learning. Making sure our lessons keep working without
interruptions is therefore our number one goal for maintenance.</p>
<p>A secondary (but still extremely important!) goal is ensuring that
the spaces we use for lesson development and maintenance are just as
welcoming and inclusive as our workshops.</p>
<p>Ensuring that our lessons are on the cutting-edge of new technology
and tooling is <em>not</em> a priority for The Carpentries. Although we
do want our materials to stay relevant, and we will talk about how we do
that later, it is far more important that our lessons remain
pedagogically sound and technically viable, than that they represent the
latest and greatest new developments in the field.</p>
<p>With these goals in mind, The Carpentries expectations of Maintainers
are that you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Monitor your lesson repository and make sure that pull requests
(PRs) and Issues are responded to in a timely manner (even if that
response is “sorry, this is out of scope”),</li>
<li>Do not introduce new errors into the lesson,</li>
<li>Quickly fix anything that is unambiguously an error or that
negatively affects workshop learners,</li>
<li>Be receptive and welcoming to suggestions for improving the lessons.
The lessons aren’t perfect!</li>
<li>Evaluate all contributions in view of The Carpentries pedagogical
model:
<ul>
<li>Teach what is most relevant and useful for learners.</li>
<li>Avoid unnecessary jargon and detailed explanations. Always ask
yourself whether it is necessary for the learner.</li>
<li>Keep language motivating.</li>
<li>Meet learners where they are.</li>
<li>Emphasise the importance of continued learning and improvement.</li>

<hr class="half-width">
<p>While anyone can contribute to The Carpentries lessons, the vast
majority of contributions come from:</p>
<ul>
<li>Trainees who have gone through Instructor Training and are
submitting a contribution as part of “checkout” to complete their
Instructor certification.</li>
<li>Workshop Instructors (and helpers) who have recently participated in
a workshop and noticed difficulties with the materials.</li>
</ul>
<p>Everyone who goes through The Carpentries Instructor Training program
is required to <a href="https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/checkout.html#getinvolved" class="external-link">get
involved</a> in the Carpentries community in order to become certified,
and contributing to a lesson is a popular option. We train over a
thousand people each year to be Instructors, about half of whom complete
the certification process. Many of the contributions you will receive
come from Instructor trainees.</p>
<p>During Instructor Training, we <a href="https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/checkout.html" class="external-link">strongly
encourage contributors</a> to contribute to discussion on existing PRs
and issues, to submit a PR to resolve an issue that the Maintainers have
marked “help wanted”, or to submit issues describing bugs or
difficulties in teaching the lesson.</p>
<p>Keeping your repository’s “help wanted” list up-to-date is a great
way to maximize useful contributions. The Carpentries website compiles
<a href="https://carpentries.org/help-wanted-issues/" class="external-link">a list of all
issues marked with the “help wanted” tag</a> across all of our official
lessons. Contributors can search this list to find places where
Maintainers have specifically requested help, making it more likely that
their contribution will be useful and accepted.</p>

<div id="help-wanted-5-minutes" class="callout-inner">
<h3 class="callout-title">Help Wanted (5 minutes)<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#help-wanted-5-minutes"></a>
</h3>
<div class="callout-content">
<p>Locate your lesson’s help wanted list.</p>
<ul>
<li>How many issues are currently open with that tag? How many have been
closed?</li>
<li>Is it clear what action is desired (i.e. what help is wanted?) for
each issue marked help wanted?</li>
<li>Are there any old issues that are out of date and are still marked
help wanted?</li>
<li>Are there any new issues that should have the help wanted tag and
don’t?</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Spending some time cleaning up your lesson’s help wanted list in your
first few months as Maintainer will save you and your co-Maintainers
time in the long term and help ensure higher-quality contributions.</p>
<p>Despite our best efforts in encouraging the types of contributions
listed above, you will also receive unwanted or unhelpful contributions,
including:</p>
<ul>
<li>addition of new material covering topics outside of the scope of the
lesson;</li>
<li>changes to the way a topic is presented that are inconsistent with
The Carpentries pedagogical model;</li>
<li>changes to the technology taught in the lesson (e.g. introduction of
a new plotting system);</li>
<li>multiple unrelated suggestions.</li>
</ul>
<p>These contributions may come in the form of an issue or a PR. Being
open to new contributions while keeping the lessons sleek and teachable
is a difficult balancing act. It’s ok to say no to a contribution when
it doesn’t add anything useful to the materials, goes beyond the scope
of the lesson, or introduces unnecessary complexity. Even when saying
no, however, we want to have positive interactions with contributors and
let them know that their involvement is valued. GitHub’s OpenSource
Guide on “Best Practices for Maintainers” includes a section on <a href="https://opensource.guide/best-practices/#learning-to-say-no" class="external-link">“learning
to say no”</a>. They recommend that you:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Thank them</strong> for their contribution.</li>
<li>
<strong>Explain why it doesn’t fit</strong> into the scope of the
project, and offer clear suggestions for improvement, if you’re able. Be
kind, but firm.</li>
<li>
<strong>Link to relevant documentation,</strong> if you have it. If
you notice repeated requests for things you don’t want to accept, add
them into your documentation to avoid repeating yourself.</li>
<li><strong>Close the request.</strong></li>

something that is broken in the lesson) or because the change is
uncontroversial (e.g. a typo fix or a small improvement to wording, etc)
and the Curriculum Team member happens to be looking at the lesson
repository at the time. When a member of the Core Team takes this
action, it is not because that they expected one of the Maintainers to

<p>Unfortunately, The Carpentries repositories occasionally receive
time-wasting contributions, for example containing spurious changes that
are not a legitimate attempt to improve the content. (Previously seen
examples have included renaming a file for no clear reason and making
unnecessary and unhelpful changes to the repository README.) Although we
generally encourage you to be thoughtful and to avoid demotivating
community members when responding to genuine contributions, you are
welcome to close any pull requests and issues that you judge to have
been opened in bad faith. If you suspect that a spammy contribution has
been made by an automated account (for example using the interaction as

that could be used as data for the bot’s training process.</p>
<p>In addition to closing the issue or pull request, please <a href="mailto:team@carpentries.org">send a short message to The
Carpentries team</a>, including the user’s username and a link to the
interaction you have concerns about, so that the Technology Team can
consider blocking the user from your and other Carpentries
repositories.</p>
<p>If you believe it is urgent that action is taken, you may receive a
response more quickly by posting to the Maintainers channel on
Slack.</p>
<p>As well as closing the pull request or issue and informing The
Carpentries team, you might consider taking either or both of the
following steps:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Adding the “invalid” label to the issue/pull request</li>
<li>Reporting the issue or pull request to GitHub by clicking
<code>...</code> at the top right of the comment box at the beginning of
the conversation thread for the issue/pull request and selecting “Report
content”. This will take you to the form for reporting violations of <a href="https://github.com/site/terms" class="external-link">GitHub’s terms of service</a>.</li>

<li>
<strong>Acknowledge receipt</strong> - Even if you won’t be able to
take action on an issue/PR immediately, send the contributor a quick
message to let them know you received and appreciate their contribution.
Always say thank you!</li>
<li>
<strong>Tag issues with descriptive labels</strong> - For
community-submitted issues, remember to add appropriate labels, even if
you are not going to immediately take action. This shows contributors
that issues are being paid attention to and encourages others to take
action on issues.</li>
<li>
<strong>Include appropriate cross-references</strong> - When putting
in a PR to address an existing Issue, include a link to the Issue.
GitHub will automatically add a note to the Issue linking back to the
PR. This is also good practice when communicating in conversation
threads on related Issues and PRs.</li>
<li>
<strong>Use the <code>@</code> symbol to tag people in a
conversation</strong> - Most people don’t subscribe to all of The
Carpentries repositories (there are a lot!) and will only get email
alerts if their GitHub handle is tagged. This is a good way to make sure
relevant people are included in the conversation. You can also use
<code>@</code> to tag your Curriculum Advisory Committee. More on that
later.</li>
<li>
<strong>Request reviews</strong> for non-trivial changes. You can
request a review from a fellow Maintainer or from someone else who has
been active on the repository. This is another way of including relevant
people in the decision-making process.</li>
<li>
<strong>Don’t merge your own PRs</strong> - Even for small PRs, it’s
a good idea to have a second person check for typos and formatting
issues. In general, always get a second opinion before merging your own
PR. This is a good time to request a review.</li>
<li>
<strong>Do edit PRs as needed</strong> - It is OK to directly edit a
contributor’s PR if there are minor issues preventing it from being
accepted. Many of our contributors are non-responsive to requests to
update a PR. This is OK. If the contribution is important - make the
minor changes and merge.</li>
<li>
<strong>Don’t close an issue or PR without explaining why</strong> -
Except in the (very rare) case of spammy contributions, take a moment to
acknowledge the contribution and explain why it won’t be
incorporated.</li>
<li>
<strong>Do close issues</strong> that have gone stale, are outdated,
or out of scope (after explaining why).</li>
<li>
<strong>Pay attention</strong> to comments about accessibility and
demotivating or exclusionary language.</li>

<p>We meet virtually on the third Wednesday of each month at two
different time slots. We will take time together to add these meetings
to your calendar in a moment.</p>
<p>Our monthly Maintainer meetings are an excellent place to connect
with the broader Maintainer community, engage in discussions around
topics of interest to Maintainers (including open Requests for Comment
(RFCs)), and stay informed about upcoming work by other parts of The
Carpentries community that may impact lesson maintenance.</p>
<p>We recognize that not everyone can attend these monthly meetings, and
so also communicate important information through our main TopicBox and
Slack channels. So don’t worry if you can’t attend! We do strongly
encourage joining from time to time, though, as it’s a good way to get
to know other Maintainers.</p>

<p>Because we are a globally distributed group, the vast majority of our
work is done asynchronously. There are three primary asynchronous
communication channels shared across the Maintainer team.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="topicbox">TopicBox<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#topicbox"></a>
</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://carpentries.topicbox.com/groups/maintainers" class="external-link">Maintainers
TopicBox list</a> is used primarily for announcements relevant to the
full Maintainer team, including reminders about upcoming meetings. Posts
from individual Maintainers asking questions or introducing topics for
discussion are extremely welcome, but our Slack channel is a more active
place for back-and-forth discussion.</p>
<p>A few lists exist around specific curricula (search for lists
starting with <code>curriculum</code>, but most have not been very
active. If you would like to have a public TopicBox list created for
discussions of your lesson, or a private list for your Maintainer team,
please <a href="mailto:team@carpentries.org">let us know</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="slack">Slack<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#slack"></a>
</h3>
<p>To be added to our private Maintainers channel on Slack, you will
need to <a href="https://slack-invite.carpentries.org/" class="external-link">join The
Carpentries organisation</a>. Our general Maintainers channel is a good
place to ask questions of the full Maintainer team, or request input on
specific issues and PRs. Most curricula also have a public Slack channel
for discussing issues with the community (browse for channels starting
with <code>dc</code>, <code>lc</code>, or <code>swc</code>). Specific
curriculum channels have not historically been very active, but we
encourage any efforts to increase interaction with the community on
these channels. You can also use curriculum-specific channels for
communicating with your co-Maintainers, or you can create a private
channel for yourself and your co-Maintainers. If you would like a
private channel to be created for you, please <a href="mailto:team@carpentries.org">let us know</a>.</p>

<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="github">GitHub<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#github"></a>
</h3>
<p>The majority of day-to-day interactions with your co-Maintainers will
be on GitHub. You will need to be subscribed to (“watching”) your lesson
repository to get email alerts about new issues, PRs, and other activity
on your lesson. You can <code>@</code> mention an individual Maintainer,
your lesson team, and / or your Curriculum Advisory Committee to ensure
that the appropriate person sees your message. Feel free also to
<code>@</code> The Carpentries Curriculum Team (Toby Hodges or Erin
Becker) using <code>@staff-curriculum</code> and the Maintainer
Community Lead (<code>@ndporter</code>).</p>

<p>Your lesson is part of an overall curriculum within a Lesson Program.
For example the <a href="https://datacarpentry.org/organization-genomics/" class="external-link">Project
Organization and Management for Genomics</a> lesson is part of the <a href="https://datacarpentry.org/genomics-workshop/" class="external-link">Genomics
curriculum</a>, which is part of the Data Carpentry Lesson Program. Data
Carpentry has several curricula, while Library Carpentry and Software
Carpentry each have a single curriculum.</p>
<p>The work that Maintainers do on routine upkeep of the lessons is
complimented by the Curriculum Advisory Committee (CAC) for each
curriculum. Curriculum Advisors provide high-level oversight, vision,
and leadership for a curriculum and guide large-scale updates.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/lesson_development/cac-consult-rubric.html" class="external-link">CAC
Consultation Rubric</a> outlines the division of responsibilities for
Maintainers and Curriculum Advisors, including</p>
<ul>
<li>issues over which Maintainers have full authority and which do not
need CAC involvement,</li>
<li>issues about which Maintainers should consult the CAC,</li>
<li>issues that may benefit from Maintainers consulting with the CAC,
but over which Maintainers retain authority, and</li>
<li>issues for which Maintainers must seek CAC approval.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each Curriculum Advisory Committee includes at least one Maintainer,
and we encourage you to apply for your curriculum’s CAC when
applications open.</p>
<p>You can tag in your Curriculum Advisory Committee on an issue in your
lesson repository using their team name (e.g. “<span class="citation">@datacarpentry/curriculum-advisors-astronomy</span>” or
“<span class="citation">@LibraryCarpentry/curriculum-advisors</span>”).
The CAC chair is responsible for watching the repository and serving as
a liaison with the curriculum’s Maintainers. Each Curriculum Advisory
Committee also has a public TopicBox list, where Maintainers and other
community members can bring issues for consideration. More information
about each CAC, including mailing list and GitHub repositories, is
available on the <a href="https://carpentries.org/curriculum-advisors/" class="external-link">Curriculum Advisors
homepage</a>.</p>

<p>This is an exciting time for The Carpentries Lesson Infrastructure!
We are in the midst of the official transition to a new infrastructure -
<a href="https://carpentries.github.io/workbench" class="external-link">The Carpentries
Workbench</a>, which is designed to be more user friendly for both
contributors and Maintainers. All lessons will transition to using the
Workbench in May 2023. This episode will teach you some of the most
important elements of the Workbench that you will need to interact with
as a Maintainer. Full documentation can be found on <a href="https://carpentries.github.io/sandpaper-docs/" class="external-link">Introduction to The
Carpentries Workbench</a>.</p>

<p>The lesson homepage provides an overview of the lesson, including any
prerequisites, an introduction to the dataset used, and any other
information learners will need for the lesson. This content is built
from the <code>index.md</code> file in the root folder of the lesson
repository.</p>
<p>The Instructor view of the lesson homepage also includes a schedule
showing the individual episodes included in the lesson, and the time
allotted for each. The schedule is automatically created based on
information present in the episode files.</p>
<p>The Learner view of the homepage includes the setup instructions for
the lesson: information about the software to install and data to
download in order to be ready to follow the lesson. This content is
built from the <code>setup.md</code> file in the <code>learners/</code>
folder of the lesson repository (more details later).</p>

<hr class="half-width">
<p>The majority of a lessons content is in its episode files. Episode
files are stored in the <code>episodes/</code> folder within your lesson
repository. Episode files are written in <em>Markdown</em> or
<em>RMarkdown</em>. The essential elements of an episode are mentioned
below. For complete information about how to construct each element of
an episode file, please see <a href="https://carpentries.github.io/sandpaper-docs/episodes.html" class="external-link">the
documentation</a>.</p>
<div class="section level3">

<p>Each episode starts with a YAML header that looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>---
title: "What is the shell?"
teaching: 5
exercises: 0
---</code></pre>
<p><code>title</code> sets the title of the episode, which will be
displayed as a top-level heading on the webpage. <code>teaching</code>
and <code>exercises</code> are values (in minutes) indicating how much
time the episode is estimated to take to teach, and for learners to
complete its exercises. The information stored in the YAML header is
used by the lesson infrastructure to populate the schedule.</p>

<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#fenced-divs"></a>
</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>As well as general explanatory content, episodes usually contain a
number of blocks of particular types, such as Instructor notes, a list
of key points, and exercises and solutions. These blocks of content are
formatted to stand out from the other content on the page, and in some
cases are treated differently by the lesson infrastructure
(e.g. Instructor notes are hidden in the Learner View of the
lesson).</p>
<p>These formatted blocks of content are added to episodes (and other
pages in the lesson site) as <em>fenced divs</em>: chunks of content
delineated (“fenced”) by lines of colon <code>:</code> symbols, with the
opening fence accompanied by a tag that defines the class of fenced div
being created.</p>
<p>For example, a fenced div belonging to the <code>callout</code> class
- used to highlight a particular block of content - can be defined
with:</p>
<pre><code>::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: callout

Some text here.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::</code></pre>

<h3 id="questions-objectives-and-keypoints">Questions, objectives, and keypoints<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#questions-objectives-and-keypoints"></a>
</h3>
<p>Every episode must contain one of each of the following types of
fenced div:</p>
<ul>
<li>Questions: Located at the top of the episode file, these are plain
language questions that show learners what to expect to gain from the
episode. Fenced div class: <code>questions</code>.</li>
<li>Objectives: Located at the top of the episode file, objectives are
specific goals that learners should be able to accomplish by the end of
the episode. Fenced div class: <code>objectives</code>.</li>
<li>Keypoints: Located at the end of the episode file, key points are
statements of the major take-aways learners should remember from each
episode. Fenced div class: <code>keypoints</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Keypoints are automatically gathered from each episode and collected
on the “Key Points” page of each lesson. Questions and Objectives are
represented in an “Overview” box at the top of each rendered episode
page.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="other-fenced-divs">Other Fenced Divs<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#other-fenced-divs"></a>
</h3>
<p>In addition to the <code>callout</code> class shown above, the
infrastructure supports several other classes of fenced div that,
although not essential, are often included in episodes.</p>
<p>Fenced divs with the tag “challenge” will render as exercises:</p>
<pre><code>::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge

<p>If this is the first time you are maintaining a project where you and

Carpentry Git lesson</a> and <a href="https://librarycarpentry.org/lc-git/" class="external-link">Library Carpentry Git
lesson</a> show you how you can interact with a repository from an owner
and Maintainer point of view because you are allowed to
<code>push</code> directly to your project on GitHub (see label 1 in the
above diagram).</p>
<p>As a Maintainer to one of our lessons, you will be able to interact
with the lesson just like it was your own repository (see label 1 in the
above diagram). The only difference is the account the repository is
under. So instead of <code>username/repo</code> it will be something
like <code>carpentries/repo</code>. This means when you get the
<code>git clone</code> url, you will have to get it from the
<code>carpentries/repo</code> location, not your own.</p>
<p>In this setup, since you are <code>clone</code>ing down from the
original <code>carpentries</code> repo, the remote will be your
<code>origin</code>. This is the same workflow as if you are working on
your own personal repository, and you can
<code>git push origin main</code>.</p>

<div class="callout-content">
<p>Some Maintainers choose to work using the forking model of
collaboration. Even though they have access to the original “upstream”
Carpentries repository, they will make a “fork” of The Carpentries
repository so they have a copy (i.e., fork) in their own account (see
label 2 in the above diagram). Using this workflow gives you (the
Maintainer) the same workflow as any other contributor to your lesson
(since contributors will also need to work on a fork).</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="forking-a-repository">Forking a Repository<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#forking-a-repository"></a>

<p>To fork a repository on GitHub, you can visit a repository and add
<code>/fork</code> at the end of the URL or you can click the “fork”
button in the top right:</p>
<figure><img src="fig/git-fork-button.png" alt="Screenshot of the top bar of swcarpentry/git-novice with four buttons on the top right: sponsor,watch, fork, and star" class="figure mx-auto d-block"></figure><p>Once you fork the repository, there will be the original “upstream”
<code>carpentries/repo</code> and your own “fork”,
<code>username/repo</code> (see label 2). When you visit your fork on
the GitHub website, you will see a grey toolbar above the file list that
says “This branch is up to date with carpentries/repo:branch.”</p>
<figure><img src="fig/git-fork-updated.png" alt='Screenshot of grey box above a file list on github that says "This branch is up to date with swcarpentry/git-novice:gh-pages." It has two buttons, one labelled "Contribute" and the other labelled "Fetch Upstream"' class="figure mx-auto d-block"></figure><p>You can <code>clone</code> your <code>username/repo</code> down to
your computer like any other repository you want to work on locally and
push and pull your changes to your remote (label 3). Because the
repository you <code>clone</code>d from is your own “fork”
(<code>username/repo</code>), the version in your account that you
cloned from is the “origin” repository (see the blue colored “origin”
label in the diagram). You can then issue a pull request (PR) to the
original <code>carpentries/repo</code> repository (see label 4).</p>
<p>For PRs from non-maintainers you will <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/reviewing-changes-in-pull-requests/reviewing-proposed-changes-in-a-pull-request" class="external-link">review
these changes</a> and ask for changes if needed. As the Maintainer, you
can review and/or accept these PRs (including your own) because as a
Maintainer you will have the repository permissions (in
<code>carpentries/repo</code>) to accept the PR (see label 5).</p>

<p>As more changes come in from other contributors and accepted by you
or other Maintainers, the forked repository (bottom right) and your own
local copy (bottom left) will be out of sync. This time, when you visit
your fork on GitHub, you will see that GitHub will show you that your
branch is <code>N commits behind</code> the upstream repository. You can
use the “Fetch upstream” button to bring those changes to your own

would set the <code>carpentries/repo</code> as a new remote called
“upstream” and then <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/getting-changes-from-a-remote-repository#pulling-changes-from-a-remote-repository" class="external-link">pull

<p>Carpentries lesson repositories are configured with <em>branch
protection</em> rules: safeguards to reduce the likelihood of
accidentally making breaking changes to the lesson. Repositories have
two protected branches:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>A rule preventing anyone from making changes to the
<code>legacy/gh-pages</code> branch, which includes the last version of
the lesson that existed before it was transitioned to a new
infrastructure in 2023. This branch exists to enable the automated
closure of pull requests made from a fork that is still using a version
of the lesson with the previous infrastructure.</li>
<li>A rule prevent anyone from changing the <code>main</code> branch
directly. This rule exists to prevent breaking or unfinished changes
from being accidentally committed to directly to the lesson.</li>
</ol>
<p>In addition to the danger of merge conflicts, the protection on the
<code>main</code> branch is another reason why you should follow a
branching/forking workflow when making changes to a lesson.</p>
