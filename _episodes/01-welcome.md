> ## Preparatory Homework
> Read through some of the issues and PRs on your assigned lesson. Are there outstanding issues? What needs maintenance? We 
will be discussing these in groups during our first session.
{: .prereq}

> ## Preparatory Homework (optional)
> Review the [Carpentries Core Values](https://carpentries.org/values/). How can you uphold and model these values as a new Maintainer?
>
{: .prereq}

> ## Pronouns and Names
> 
> Using correct names and pronouns is important to setting a tone of respect. Learning these is hard to
> do quickly, so we recommend displaying it prominently during the workshop. 
> 
> If on Zoom, give everyone a moment to update their display name to reflect this information. 
> 
> If in person, encourage attendees to put this information on worn name tags or table-displayed name placards.
> 
> Note that pronouns are personal and some participants might prefer not to share them.
> Do not force people to share their pronouns.
{: .challenge}

> ## Introductions
> 
> Ask participants to (quickly!) introduce themselves with their name,
institution, background, curriculum assigned, and potentially a short icebreaker
question ("Tell us one good thing that happened in the past week.") This is
important for participants to begin to meet each other and develop relationships
with other Maintainers.

## Code of Conduct

To make clear what is expected, everyone participating in Carpentries activities is required
to conform to our [Code of Conduct](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/code-of-conduct.html). This Code of Conduct applies to all spaces managed by the Carpentries including, but not limited to workshops, email lists, online forums and on GitHub. Please review
[the Code of Conduct](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/code-of-conduct.html) to familiarise yourself with it.

> ## Zoom Etiquette
> In the first session, ensure that you cover multiple ways for individuals to raise 
their hands so that few individuals do not dominate the conversation: they can use the 
Zoom "Raise Hand" feature, type "/hand" in the chat, or ask their question in the chat.
>
> Additionally, indicate whether or not individuals should have their camera on or off. 
In order to encourage folks to get to know each other, I recommend camera-on unless 
conditions prevent cameras from being on (i.e. broadband issues, family needs, etc.)

## Maintainer Onboarding Overview

The goal of this three-week training is to provide you with the skills and information you need to 
become a Carpentries Lesson Maintainer. Our expectations of Carpentries Lesson Maintainers are that they:

-  Monitor their lesson repository and make sure that PRs and Issues are addressed in a timely manner
- Participate in the lesson development cycle including lesson releases
- Endeavour to be welcoming and supportive of contributions from all members of the community
- Give feedback to contributors and evaluate lesson contributions in light of The Carpentries pedagogical model

> ## Maintainer Guidelines
> You can find more details about [Maintainer Guidelines](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/maintainers/maintainers.html) in the Carpentries documentation.
{: .callout}

These goals will be achieved with a 3-week Maintainer Onboarding course, with the following goals:

- Orienting you to The Carpentries model and building relationships with other Lesson Maintainers within The Carpentries
- Practicing Maintainer skills and cultivating a positive environment for contributors
- Familiarizing you with the broader social and technical infrastructure around individual Carpentries lessons and curricula

## What This Onboarding Does Not Cover

We will **not** be teaching you everything you need to know about Git in this 3-week training. 
We will provide you with an introduction to the basic skills to respond to issues and PRs. 
The best way to learn Git is to work with it, and we encourage you to reach out to your co-Maintainers and others in the Maintainer community for support and resources.
We will not discuss Lesson Development extensively as these processes are undergoing revision.
