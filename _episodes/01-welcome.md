> ## Pronouns and Names
> 
> Using correct names and pronouns is important to setting a tone of respect. Learning these is hard to
> do quickly, so we recommend displaying it prominently during the workshop. 
> 
> If on Zoom, give everyone a moment to update their display name to reflect this information. 
> 
> If in person, encourage attendees to put this information on worn name tags or table-displayed name placards.
> 
> Note that pronouns are personal and some participants might prefer not to share them.
> Do not force people to share their pronouns.

## Code of Conduct

To make clear what is expected, everyone participating in The Carpentries activities is required
to conform to our [Code of Conduct]({{ site.coc }}). This Code of Conduct applies to all spaces managed by The Carpentries including, but not limited to workshops, email lists, online forums and on GitHub. Please review
[the Code of Conduct]({{ site.coc }}) to familiarise yourself with it.

> ## Zoom Etiquette
> In the first session, ensure that you cover multiple ways for individuals to raise 
their hands so that few individuals do not dominate the conversation: they can use the 
Zoom "Raise Hand" feature, type "/hand" in the chat, or ask their question in the chat.
>
> Additionally, indicate whether or not individuals should have their camera on or off. 
In order to encourage folks to get to know each other, I recommend camera-on unless 
conditions prevent cameras from being on (i.e. broadband issues, family needs, etc.)

> ## Introductions
> 
> Ask participants to (quickly!) introduce themselves with their name,
institution, background, curriculum assigned, and potentially a short icebreaker
question ("Tell us one good thing that happened in the past week.") This is
important for participants to begin to meet each other and develop relationships
with other Maintainers.

## Maintainer Onboarding Overview

The goal of this training is to provide you with the skills and information you need to 
become a Carpentries Lesson Maintainer. Our expectations of Carpentries Lesson Maintainers are that they:

- Monitor their lesson repository and make sure that PRs and Issues are addressed in a timely manner
- Participate in the lesson development cycle including lesson releases
- Endeavour to be welcoming and supportive of contributions from all members of the community
- Give feedback to contributors and evaluate lesson contributions in light of The Carpentries pedagogical model

> ## Maintainer Guidelines
> You can find more details about [Maintainer Guidelines](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/maintainers/maintainers.html) in the Carpentries documentation.

During this training, we will:

- Orient you to The Carpentries goals and vision for lesson maintanence
- Help you get connected with other Maintainers and the overall Maintainer community
- Develop skills for creating a positive environment for all contributors
- Become familiar with the key components of the lesson template
- Practice core technical skills for lesson maintanence
- Learn how and when to elevate issues to the Curriculum Advisory Committee

## What This Onboarding Does Not Cover

The Carpentries supports over 40 official lessons across our three Lesson Programs (Data Carpentry, Library Carpentry, and Software Carpentry). 
At any given time, there are also dozens of community-supported lessons in active development in 
[The Carpentries Incubator](https://carpentries-incubator.org/). This training is intended for Maintainers of official lessons, and we will 
not cover how new lessons are developed, vetted, and adopted into The Carpentries core lesson stack. Those interested in curriculum 
development are encouraged to read The Carpentries [Curriculum Development Handbook](https://cdh.carpentries.org/). 

We do not expect you to be an expert in Git or GitHub, or even to have used these tools at all in the past. We will provide you with
an introduction to the core skills you need to respond to uncomplicated issues and pull requests, 
however, there will undoubtedly be more complicated maintanence situations that require Git skills beyond what we will cover in this training. 
The best way to learn Git is to work with it, and we encourage you to reach out to your co-Maintainers and others in the Maintainer community
for support and resources. We have regular co-working sessions where you can bring questions to the group, and also provide each other
support in asynchronous communication channels. We'll introduce those channels momentarily.

{: .challenge}

## Goals for Lesson Maintanence

Introductory and explanatory text here. 

- Do not introduce new errors into the lesson. 
- Quickly fix anything that is unambiguously an error or that negatively affects workshop learners. 
- Be receptive and welcoming to suggestions for improving the lessons. They arenâ€™t perfect!
- Evaluate all contributions in view of The Carpentries pedagogical model
    - Sacrifice technical correctness for usability and user friendliness. 
    - Meet learners where they are at. 
    - Avoid unnecessary jargon and detailed explanations. Always ask yourself whether it is necessary for the learner. 
    - Introduce connections on mental models, not just new content.
