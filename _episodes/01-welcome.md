> ## Pronouns and Names
> 
> Using correct names and pronouns is important to setting a tone of respect. Learning these is hard to
> do quickly, so we recommend displaying it prominently during the workshop. 
> 
> If on Zoom, give everyone a moment to update their display name to reflect this information. 
> 
> If in person, encourage attendees to put this information on worn name tags or table-displayed name placards.
> 
> Note that pronouns are personal and some participants might prefer not to share them.
> Do not force people to share their pronouns.

We have a range of folks with different levels of previous experience with The Carpentries and different types of technical background. 
We are not all experts in Git or any other specific software. That is ok! You will learn some of the specific things you need to interact 
with The Carpentries lessons on GitHub during this training and get information about how to continue learning and growing in this role. 

## Maintainer Onboarding Overview

The goal of this training is to provide you with the skills and information you need to 
become a Carpentries Maintainer. During this training, we will:

- Orient you to The Carpentries goals and vision for lesson maintanence
- Help you get connected with other Maintainers and the overall Maintainer community
- Develop skills for creating a positive environment for all contributors
- Become familiar with the key components of the lesson template
- Practice core technical skills for lesson maintanence
- Learn how and when to elevate issues to your Curriculum Advisory Committee

## What This Onboarding Does Not Cover

The Carpentries supports over 40 official lessons across our three Lesson Programs (Data Carpentry, Library Carpentry, and Software Carpentry). 
At any given time, there are also dozens of community-supported lessons in active development in 
[The Carpentries Incubator](https://carpentries-incubator.org/). This training is intended for Maintainers of official lessons, and we will 
not cover how new lessons are developed, vetted, and adopted into The Carpentries core lesson stack. Those interested in curriculum 
development are encouraged to read The Carpentries [Curriculum Development Handbook](https://cdh.carpentries.org/). 

We do not expect you to be an expert in Git or GitHub, or even to have used these tools at all in the past. We will provide you with
an introduction to the core skills you need to respond to uncomplicated issues and pull requests, 
however, there will undoubtedly be more complicated maintanence situations that require Git skills beyond what we will cover in this training. 
The best way to learn Git is to work with it, and we encourage you to reach out to your co-Maintainers and others in the Maintainer community
for support and resources. We have regular co-working sessions where you can bring questions to the group, and also provide each other
support in asynchronous communication channels. We'll introduce those channels momentarily. 
The Software-Carpentry [Git Novice lesson](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/) is also a great resource for learning and reviewing the basics you will need to maintain your lesson.

## Goals for Lesson Maintanence

The Carpentries teaches 400 - 600 workshops each year, meaning our lesson materials are being used practically every day for
synchronous, guided learning. Making sure our lessons keep working uninteruptedly is therefore our number one goal for maintanence.

A secondary (but still extremely important!) goal is ensuring that the spaces we use for lesson development and maintanence
are just as welcoming and inclusive as our workshops. 

Ensuring that our lessons are on the cutting-edge of new technology and tooling is *not* a priority for The Carpentries. Although
we do want our materials to stay relevant, and we will talk about how we do that later, it is far more important that our lessons
remain pedagogically sound and technically viable than that they represent the latest and greatest new developments in the field.

With these goals in mind, The Carpentries expectations of Maintainers are that you:

- Monitor your lesson repository and make sure that pull requests (PRs) and Issues are responded to in a timely manner (even if that response is "sorry, this is out of scope"),
- Do not introduce new errors into the lesson, 
- Quickly fix anything that is unambiguously an error or that negatively affects workshop learners, 
- Be receptive and welcoming to suggestions for improving the lessons. They aren’t perfect!
- Evaluate all contributions in view of The Carpentries pedagogical model:
    - Teach what is most relevant and useful for learners.
    - Avoid unnecessary jargon and detailed explanations. Always ask yourself whether it is necessary for the learner. 
    - Keep language motivating.
    - Meet learners where they are.
    - Emphasise the importance of continued learning and improvement.

can expect to receive, and how to apply The Carpentries [Core Values](https://carpentries.org/values/) to communicating with contributors.
