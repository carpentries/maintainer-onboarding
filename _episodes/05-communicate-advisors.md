Your lesson is part of an overall curriculum within a Lesson Program. For example
the [Project Organization and Management for Genomics](https://datacarpentry.org/organization-genomics/) lesson
is part of the [Genomics curriculum](https://datacarpentry.org/genomics-workshop/), 
which is part of the Data Carpentry Lesson Program. Data Carpentry has several curricula, 
while Library Carpentry and Software Carpentry have a single curriculum. 

The work that Maintainers do on day-to-day upkeep of the lessons
is complimented by the Curriculum Advisory Committee (CAC) for 
each curriculum. Curriculum Advisors provide high-level oversight, vision, and leadership 
for a curriculum and guide large-scale updates.

The [CAC Consultation Rubric](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ifrEbkqqBK0Nc6A6HlcWtiu_SjOoFbc-HjfWkLk9nJA/edit) outlines the division of
responsibilities for Maintainers and Curriculum Advisors, including
- issues over which Maintainers have full authority and which do not need CAC involvement,
- issues about which Maintainers should consult the CAC,
- issues that may benefit from Maintainers consulting with the CAC, but over which Maintainers retain authority, and 
- issues for which Maintainers must seek CAC approval.

Curriculum Advisory Committees have been on hiatus from mid-2019 until present. 
As of September 2021, we will be recruiting new Curriculum Advisors for the following curricula:

- [Software Carpentry](https://carpentries.org/workshops-curricula/#swc-all)
- [Data Carpentry Ecology](https://carpentries.org/workshops-curricula/#dc-ecology)
- [Data Carpentry Geospatial](https://carpentries.org/workshops-curricula/#dc-geospatial)
- [Data Carpentry Genomics](https://carpentries.org/workshops-curricula/#dc-genomics)
- [Data Carpentry Social Sciences](https://carpentries.org/workshops-curricula/#dc-socialsci)
- [Data Carpentry Image Processing](https://datacarpentry.org/image-processing/)
- [Data Carpentry Astronomy](https://datacarpentry.org/astronomy-python/)

The [Library Carpentry Curriculum Advisory Committee](https://librarycarpentry.org/cac/) has 
already been assembled. 

Each CAC should include at least one Maintainer, and we encourage you to apply. The application
will be shared on the official Maintainer channels in early September. CACs should start 
to meet in October - November 2021.

> ## Urgent Issues
> If any urgent issues arise which would normally be under the authority of the CAC,
> and the CAC for your curriculum has not yet convened, please contact
> the Curriculum Team for support and assistance.

Once the Curriculum Advisory Committee for your lesson is convened, you can
tag them in on an issue using their team name. The CAC chair will be watching the
repository and responsible for serving as a liaison with the curriculum's Maintainers. 
Each Curriculum Advisory Committee will also have a public TopicBox list, where
Maintainers and other community members can bring issues for consideration.

> ## Which strategy? (5 minutes)
> Match the issue with the correct strategy for resolving it. 
> 
> a) Needs elevation to CAC
> b) Simple fix by a single Maintainer without review
> c) Put in a PR and wait for another Maintainer to review
> d) Raise the issue for conversation at Maintainer co-working corral or on email list
