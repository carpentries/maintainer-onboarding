## Synchronous communications

There are two opportunities to connect with the overall Maintainer team each month. 

### Maintainer meetings

We meet virtually on the third Wednesday of each month at two different time slots. You can add these meetings to your
calendar either by 
- subscribing to The Carpentries [community calendar](https://carpentries.org/community/#community-events) and
copying events to your Google Calendar, or 
- clicking the TimeandDate links on the Maintainers [CodiMD pad](https://codimd.carpentries.org/maintainers?both) to convert
the events to your local time, and adding to your calendar manually. 
We will take time to do this together momentarily. 

Our monthly Maintainer meetings are an excellent place to connect with the broader Maintainer community, engage in discussions
around topics of interest to Maintainers (including open Requests for Comment (RFCs)), and stay informed about upcoming 
work by other sub-communities or committees that may impact lesson maintanence. 

We recognize that not everyone can attend these monthly meetings, and so also communicate important information through 
our main TopicBox and Slack channels. So don't worry if you can't attend! We do strongly encourage joining from time to time, 
though, as it's a good way to get to know other Maintainers. 

### Maintainer co-working corrals

On the first Wednesday of each month, we get together for a co-working session. This is a good time to get input
from other Maintainers, and from the Maintainer Community Lead (Daniel Chen), on difficult or tricky issues. Co-working
with Maintainers on other lessons also provides you with a broader overall vision of The Carpentries curriculum stack. It's
a great opportunity to engage in lateral knowledge transfer and community learning!

To add an issue or PR to the co-working corral agenda, DAN PLEASE ADD HERE APPROPRIATE THING TO DO. It's also perfectly fine
to join the meetings without a specific issue already selected to work on. You do not need to attend the monthly Maintainer 
meetings to join the co-working corrals, and vice versa. All Maintainers are welcome!

In addition to these monthly opportunities to connect across the broad Maintainer community, you are encouraged to
set up regular check-ins with your lesson team. The next section will provide more information about how to stay
in touch with both the overall Maintainer community and your specific lesson team. 

## Asynchronous communications

Because we are a globally distributed group, the vast majority of our work is done asynchronously. There are three primary
asynchronous communication channels shared across the Maintainer team. 

### TopicBox



### Slack


### GitHub
[RFC repo](https://github.com/carpentries/maintainer-RFCs/)




## General Carpentries News

Subscribing to these channels will ensure you are up to date on issues affecting your lesson and lesson maintenance in general. 
To have a broader overview of all the exciting activity going on in The Carpentries community, we recommend subscribing to 
one or more of the following channels:

If you would **really** like to keep up to date on **everything** that is happening, The Carpentries maintains a variety of
[mailing lists on TopicBox](https://carpentries.topicbox.com) and over 100 [Slack channels](https://carpentries.org/connect/#slack), 
including spaces dedicated to discussion of particular curricula, connecting local and regional groups, and job opportunites.
