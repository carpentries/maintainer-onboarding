## Synchronous communications

There are two opportunities to connect with the overall Maintainer team each month. 

### Maintainer meetings

We meet virtually on the third Wednesday of each month at two different time slots. You can add these meetings to your
calendar either by 
- subscribing to The Carpentries [community calendar](https://carpentries.org/community/#community-events) and
copying events to your Google Calendar, or 
- clicking the TimeandDate links on the Maintainers [CodiMD pad](https://codimd.carpentries.org/maintainers?both) to convert
the events to your local time, and adding to your calendar manually. 
We will take time to do this together momentarily. 

Our monthly Maintainer meetings are an excellent place to connect with the broader Maintainer community, engage in discussions
around topics of interest to Maintainers (including open Requests for Comment (RFCs)), and stay informed about upcoming 
work by other sub-communities or committees that may impact lesson maintanence. 

We recognize that not everyone can attend these monthly meetings, and so also communicate important information through 
our main TopicBox and Slack channels. So don't worry if you can't attend! We do strongly encourage joining from time to time, 
though, as it's a good way to get to know other Maintainers. 

### Maintainer co-working corrals

On the first Wednesday of each month, we get together for a co-working session. This is a good time to get input
from other Maintainers, and from the Maintainer Community Lead, on difficult or tricky issues. Co-working
with Maintainers on other lessons also provides you with a broader overall vision of The Carpentries curriculum stack. It's
a great opportunity to engage in lateral knowledge transfer and community learning!

Any Maintainer can add an issue or PR to the co-working corral agenda by adding it to the 
[CodiMD pad](https://codimd.carpentries.org/maintainers?both). It is also perfectly fine
to join the meetings without a specific issue already selected to work on. You do not need to attend the monthly Maintainer 
meetings to join the co-working corrals, and vice versa. All Maintainers are welcome!

In addition to these monthly opportunities to connect across the broad Maintainer community, you are encouraged to
set up regular check-ins with your lesson team. The next section will provide more information about how to stay
in touch with both the overall Maintainer community and your specific lesson team. 

## Asynchronous communications

Because we are a globally distributed group, the vast majority of our work is done asynchronously. There are three primary
asynchronous communication channels shared across the Maintainer team. 

### TopicBox

The [Maintainers TopicBox list](https://carpentries.topicbox.com/groups/maintainers) is used primarily for announcements
relevant to the full Maintainer team, including reminders about upcoming meetings. Posts from individual Maintainers asking
questions or introducing topics for discussion are extremely welcome, but our Slack channel does seem to be a more active
place for back-and-forth discussion.

A few lists exist around specific curricula (search for lists starting with "curriculum", but most have not been very active. 
If you would like to have a public TopicBox list created for discussions of your lesson, or a private list for your Maintainer 
team, please [let Erin know](mailto: ebecker@carpentries.org). 

### Slack

To be added to our private Maintainers channel on Slack, you will need to 
[join The Carpentries organisation](https://swc-slack-invite.herokuapp.com/). 
Our general Maintainers channel is a good place to ask questions of the full Maintainers team, or request input
on specific issues/PRs. Most curricula also have a public Slack channel for discussing issues with the community (browse 
for channels starting with `dc`, `lc`, or `swc`). Specific curriculum channels have not historically been very active, 
but we encourage any efforts to increase interaction with the community on these channels. You can also use curriculum-specific
channels for communicating with your lesson team, or you can create a private channel for yourself and your co-Maintainers. 
If you would like a private channel to be created for you, please [let Erin know](mailto: ebecker@carpentries.org).

### GitHub

The majority of day-to-day interactions with your co-Maintainers will be on GitHub. You will need to be subscribed to
("watching") your lesson repository to get email alerts about new issues, PRs, and other activity on your lesson. You can 
`@` mention an individual Maintainer, your lesson team, and / or your Curriculum Advisory
Committee to ensure that the appropriate person sees your message. Feel free also to `@` The Carpentries
Curriculum Team (Toby Hodges, Erin Becker, FranÃ§ois Michonneau, Zhian Kamvar, Michael Culshaw-Maurer) using `@staff-curriculum` and 
the Maintainer Community Lead.

> ## Tagging in your Lesson Team
> Each group of Maintainers is associated with a GitHub team. You can find the name of your team below:
> - [Library Carpentry Maintainer teams](https://github.com/orgs/LibraryCarpentry/teams/lesson-maintainers/teams)
> - [Software Carpentry Maintainer teams](https://github.com/orgs/swcarpentry/teams/lesson-maintainers/teams)
> - Data Carpentry lessons have an additional level of structure, as each lesson belongs to a curriculum within this 
> Lesson Program. You can tag the full set of Maintainers for an entire curriculum (e.g. Ecology) using the 
> [team names listed here](https://github.com/orgs/datacarpentry/teams/lesson-maintainers/teams) or click on 
> your curriculum and then "Teams" on the top menu to find the name of your lesson team.
{: .callout}

> ## What is your lesson team's name? (3 minutes)
> Find your lessson team's name and add it to the Etherpad. Note: After you complete this onboarding, Erin will
> add you to the appropriate lesson team. You will need to accept the invitation to join the team.
{: .challenge}

> ## Tagging in the Curriculum Team 
> To tag in the curriculum team on any repository hosted in one of the official lesson program GitHub organisations
> (Data Carpentry, Library Carpentry, Software Carpentry), use `@staff-curriculum`. On The Carpentries GitHub org,
> the team name is `@core-team-curriculum`. We are working on reconciling team names across GitHub organisations.
{: .callout}

We also highly recommend subscribing to the
[Maintainer RFC (request for comments) repository](https://github.com/carpentries/maintainer-RFCs/). This repository is
the primary platform for asynchronous discussion and feedback from the Maintainer community on issues affecting Maintainers
as a whole. We try to remember to announce new RFCs on TopicBox and Slack, but staying subscribed here will allow you to see
other's comments as they come in. To leave your feedback on an existing RFC, go to Issues and leave a comment. We also
discuss RFCs at monthly Maintainer meetings to allow for a more nuanced back-and-forth conversation. 

## General Carpentries News

{: .challenge} 

> ## Maintainer Capacity
> Signing on as a Maintainer is not a lifelong commitment! The Carpentries recognises that
> this is a volunteer role and is committed to supporting your mental and emotional health. 
> You are always free to step down from the Maintainer role, either permanently or to take a 
> break. If you plan to take a short break (a couple of weeks), please let your co-Maintainers know.
> For longer breaks (a few months or longer), or if you would like to step down
> permanently, please notify the Curriculum Team so we can find someone else to support the lesson.
> 
> This also applies in reverse! If you are not able to get in touch with at least one other Maintainer
> for your lesson, please get in touch with the Curriculum Team. We may need to find more Maintainers to
> support the lesson.
