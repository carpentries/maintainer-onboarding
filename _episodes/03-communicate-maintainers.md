If you can’t get in touch with at least one other Maintainer for your lesson, 
contact the Curriculum Team to let us know. We may need to find more Maintainers for your lesson.

If you’re going to need to take an extended break (more than a week or two), let your co-Maintainers know. 
For longer breaks, notify the Curriculum Team. 

Be familiar with the structure and purpose of the RFC repository. Know how to leave your feedback there.
