> ## Preparatory Homework
> Please read the [Lesson Example](http://swcarpentry.github.io/lesson-example/) before our meeting this week.
> The Lesson Example includes information about all the formatting
> you are likely to see in your lesson, as well as instructions
> on how to locally render changes. If you are not maintaining an
> R lesson, you can skip the episode on `Using RMarkdown`. Please
> come prepared to discuss any questions you have about formatting.
{: .prereq}

> ## Preparatory Homework (optional)
> Follow the [instructions for installing Jekyll](https://carpentries.github.io/lesson-example/setup#jekyll-setup-for-lesson-development) and its dependencies.
> Then clone a copy of your lesson repository to your local computer. For example:
>
> ~~~
> $ git clone https://github.com/carpentries/maintainer-onboarding.git
> ~~~
> {: .language-bash}
>
> Navigate to your cloned copy of the repository and preview it
> locally using:
>
> ~~~
> $ make serve
> ~~~
> {: .language-bash}
>
> You should see output that ends with something like:
>
> ~~~
> Server address: http://127.0.0.1:4000
> Server running... press ctrl-c to stop.
> ~~~
> {: .output}
>
> Enter the server address into your web browser to see your local
> website.
>
> If this doesn't work for you, don't worry! We're going to be
> troubleshooting together in breakout groups.

## Maintainers and Forked Repositories

Congratulations! You're a lesson maintainer!
If this is the first time you're maintaining a project where you and other people are going to be submitting changes there are two perspectives you need to keep in mind:
one of the "contributor" and one of the "maintainer".

- Contributors: cannot directly `push` code to the repository
- Maintainers: *can* directly `push` code to the repository

The 
[Software Carpentry Git lesson](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/) and
[Library Carpentry Git lesson](https://librarycarpentry.org/lc-git/)
show you how you can interact with a repository from an ownder and maintainer point of view
because you are allowed to `push` directly to your project on github.

> ## Follow-up Homework
> Get in touch with your Lesson Team to schedule an initial
> meeting. At this meeting, be sure to discuss the issues in the list
> generated above. Communicating by email can also help to set the
> stage for your initial meeting and clarify any of these items
> after the meeting.
