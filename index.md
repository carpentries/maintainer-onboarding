Welcome to The Carpentries Maintainer onboarding! By keeping the
lessons running smoothly and making sure that they conform
to The Carpentries pedagogical model, Maintainers form the
backbone of The Carpentries community. This training is 
designed to prepare new Maintainers for this role, including:

## Communicating with Contributors
Maintainers facilitate collaboration on lesson
development and are often the first point of contact
for new contributors to The Carpentries community. They play a
prominent role in representing The Carpentries community online.
You will develop and practice skills for creating a positive environment for all contributors,
and learn about how The Carpentries Core Values apply to your role as a Maintainer.

## Communicating with other Maintainers and Curriculum Advisors
As a new Maintainer,
you are part of a large team supporting over 40 official lessons within The Carpentries
ecosystem. You will learn how to connect with other Maintainers, The Carpentries Curriculum
Team, and the Maintainer Community Lead for advice and support. You will also learn
about the role of the Curriculum Advisory Committees, and understand
how lesson Maintianers and Curriculum Advisors work together to support the lessons.

## Interacting with the technical infrastructure supporting The Carpentries lessons
Maintainers ensure that The Carpentries lessons
have a consistent look and feel by following styling guidelines and
formatting conventions. You will become familiar with key components of The Carpentries 
lesson template and practice core technical skills for lesson maintanence through GitHub.
