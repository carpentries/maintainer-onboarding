Welcome to Carpentry Maintainer onboarding! By keeping the
lessons running smoothly and making sure that they conform
to the Carpentry's pedagogical model, Maintainers form the
backbone of the Carpentry team. Over the next three weeks, you will
be introduced to the three major aspects of the Carpentry
Maintainer's role in the community - the social aspects, curricular
aspects, and technical aspects.

1. Social aspects: Maintainers facilitate collaboration on lesson
development and are often the first point of contact
for new contributors to the Carpentry community. They play a
prominent role in representing the Carpentry community online.

2. Curricular aspects: Maintainers make sure that their lessons
stay up-to-date, function smoothly, represent an appropriate level of material, and
stay in line with changes in the overall workshop curriculum.

3. Technical aspects: Maintainers ensure that Carpentry lessons
have a consistent look and feel by following styling guidelines and
formatting conventions.
