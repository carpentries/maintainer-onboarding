Welcome to The Carpentries Maintainer onboarding! By keeping the
lessons running smoothly and making sure that they conform
to The Carpentries pedagogical model, Maintainers form the
backbone of The Carpentries community. Over the next three weeks, you will
be introduced to the three major aspects of The Carpentries
Maintainer's role in the community - the social aspects, curricular
aspects, and technical aspects.

1. Social aspects: Maintainers facilitate collaboration on lesson
development and are often the first point of contact
for new contributors to The Carpentries community. They play a
prominent role in representing The Carpentries community online.

2. Curricular aspects: Maintainers make sure that their lessons
stay up-to-date, function smoothly, represent an appropriate level of material, and
stay in line with changes in the overall curriculum for that workshop.

3. Technical aspects: Maintainers ensure that Carpentries lessons
have a consistent look and feel by following styling guidelines and
formatting conventions.
